/*
Some variable explanation
let N = number of customers + depot (refer to the question)
policy is a 3D array of size (level x N x N), you may initialize it with all 0s
globalPolicy is one of the policy level with size (N x N) that used by rollout function, similiary you can just initialize it with all 0s

here is a list of configuration parameters setup:
level = 3
iterations = 100
ALPHA = 1

you can try to play around with the configuration parameters and policy to see what's their effect on the outcome
