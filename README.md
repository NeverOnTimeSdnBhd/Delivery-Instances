# Delivery-Instances

## Introduction
1. Welcome to WIA1002/WIB1002 Data Structure course Session 2020/2021 Semester 2 Group Project 2!  
2. This project is about exploring different methods to search for a best route with limited time!  
3. I believe it will definitely benefit you as most of the time you would be facing resource limit issue (time/memory) in real word cases thus most of the time theoretical searching algorithm taught in the class are not that useful.  
4. As mentioned in the question, should you have any problem please don't hesitate to raise an issue here.  
5. Good luck and have fun on this project!

|`greedy`     |Folder contains one markdown file to explain what the `greedy simulation` means in the question.                                                 |
|`instances`  |Resource folder that contains all test sets you can play with.                                                                                   |
|`mcts`       |Folder contains pseudocode for MCTS algorithm. In future if I have any resources want to share regarding MCTS I will put in this folder as well. |
|`update`     |Folder contains original question and one markdown file for any update on question or further clarification made.                                |
